### 🕵️‍♀️ Mission: Useful Functions to Do "Stuff" with Files! 🕵️‍♀️

## 🗂️ Stuff:
### 🔍 Checking
- Get a list of filenames in a directory (because intel is key!)

### 🛠️ Creating
- Create a file (your secret documents await!)
- Name a file (give it a cool codename!)
- Delete a file (oops, time to erase the evidence!)
- Create a directory (build your secret lair!)
- Name a directory (make it sound mysterious!)

### 🌐 URL to Local File 
- Download results of an HTTP/S GET to URL (fetching intel!)
- Write URL response to a file (saving the mission report!)

### ❌ Deleting
- Delete files by name (no traces left behind!)
- Delete directories by name (cleaning up the scene!)

### ✏️ Renaming
- Rename a file (time for a makeover!)

### 📦 Moving
- Move a file from one location to another (relocating assets!)

### 📄 Copying
- Copy a file from one location to another (double the fun!)
- Copy all files from one directory to another (mission accomplished!)
